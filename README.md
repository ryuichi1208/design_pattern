## what is design_pattern

Design pattern in software development is the one that accumulated design know-how discovered and created by past software designers, cataloged them according to specific conventions so as to name them and to easily reuse them.

## Pattern

In software engineering, a software design pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. It is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into source or machine code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations. Design patterns are formalized best practices that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system.
